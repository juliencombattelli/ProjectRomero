# Romero project : Automating Construction Machinery

Autonomous vehicles will, in the near future, completely redefine our mobility model. This autonomy consists of replacing human driving with software. This can range from limited steering assistance to total automation of the vehicle. While road tests will be allowed (especially in California), many ethical issues remain unsolved. The Automating Construction Machinery project focuses on Asimov's compliance with the rules that a robot must not endanger a human's life or personal safety. In the event of an accident, how should an autonomous car react to the risk based on the lives of passengers or pedestrians?
